        "Consider a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin $(0,0)$.  So the area of the circle is $A(R) = \\pi R^2$.  A **lattice point** is a point $(a,b)$ with integer coordinates, i.e., $a$ and $b$ are integers.  Let $L(R)$ be the number of lattice points contained inside the circle of radius $R$.  In other words, $L(R)$ is the number of points $(a,b)$ with integers $a,b$ satisfying $a^2 + b^2 \\leq R^2$.  (Note I've used a less-than-or-equal here).\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  (Must do:) Write a function to compute $L(R)$.  Try to make it compute $L(R)$ quickly, if you can, even if $R$ is big (like 1000 perhaps, or maybe much bigger).  But be careful... don't ask your computer to try $L(1000000)$ until you try some smaller inputs and see how long it will take.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Analyze the \"error\" $E(R) = A(R) - L(R)$.  How does this grow, relative to the size of $R$?  Does it grow as fast as $R^2$?  As fast as $R$?  As fast as $\\sqrt{R}$?  As fast as $R^{2/3}$?  How can you use Python, and your math skills, to carry out this analysis?  Conduct this analysis with a combination of Python code and text blocks to explain what you're doing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  There are many variants on this topic.  For example, spheres in 3-d instead of circles.  Or ellipses instead of circles.  Or different kinds of lattices besides the usual \"square grid\" of integer-coordinates.  Try one variant, and describe your findings.\n",
